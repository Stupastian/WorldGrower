  <h2>WorldGrower:Crime</h2>
  
	Crime occurs when a character breaks the law.<br>
	In the governance dialog is an overview of actions:<br>
	<br>
	<img src="legalactions.png"><br>
	<br>
	When a character performs an action that's not legal, several things happen:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Bounty</b>: depending on the severity of the crime, the character's bounty will increase.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Membership</b>: Attacking someone will result in being declared an outlaw and being kicked out of the villagers faction.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Relationship</b>: There is a large chance that someone dislikes the action, resulting in them disliking the character.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	The consequences of a bounty and/or being an outlaw are as follows:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Bounty</b>: if a character has a bounty and is not an outlaw, a guard may collect the bounty.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Membership</b>: if someone is an outlaw, a guard may attack to subdue the character and throw them in jail.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	When an illegal action occurs, and only the perpetrator and the victim are present, it doesn't count as a crime.<br>
	This is because it's the words of those two persons against each other.<br>
	<br>
	It possible to change the law by becoming leader of the villagers.<br>
	Any changes will be reflected in the governance dialog.<br>
