    <h1>Vision of WorldGrower</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Player characters and non-player characters have the same
      abilities</h2>
    This means that both can build buildings, craft items, start
    conversations, etc.<br>
    The world is one interconnected place with the flow of goods and
    gold.<br>
    If player characters and non-player characters have the same
    abilities,<br>
    then the player character is automatically drawn into the flow of
    goods and gold.<br>
    <br>
    This also evens the playing field: non-player characters don't get
    any special treatment <br>
    or bonuses so they must succeed on their own merit.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>The economy is an interconnected web</h2>
    The economy is interconnected: this means that to do or make
    something, you need resources.<br>
    You can try to obtain all resources yourself, but it's often better
    to get resources from specialized characters.<br>
    Specialization pays of with better quality or less effort to create
    something.<br>
    <br>
    This also means that if you try to sell something, it's easier if
    you have fewer competitors or lower prices.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Actions have consequences</h2>
    As stated before, fewer competitors means more sales.<br>
    If you attack someone, guards will arrest you.<br>
    If the leader of the village gets killed, a new leader gets elected.<br>
    Killing all farmers might lead to famine.<br>
    <br>
    Since every character has the same abilities and everything is
    connected, most actions will have consequences.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Extensive dialogue system</h2>
    There are a lot of dialogue options.<br>
    These allow you to share information, lie, intimidate or sweet talk
    someone.<br>
    <br>
    These dialogue options are the same for player characters and
    non-player characters.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Knowledge</h2>
    Non-player characters don't automatically know everything.<br>
    They obtain knowledge by observation and sharing of information by
    talking to each other.<br>
