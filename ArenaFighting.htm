  <h2>WorldGrower:Arena Fighting</h2>
  
	Arena fighting can start after someone builds an arena.<br>
	That character becomes the arena owner.<br>
	<br>
	Arena fighters can ask the arena owner to fight.<br>
	Once two arena fighters are ready, the fight starts.<br>
	<br>
	Once 1 fighter is reduced to 1 hit point or lower, that character wins.<br>
	Then both characters can collect a pay check from the arena owner.<br>
