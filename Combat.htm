  <h2>WorldGrower:Combat</h2>
  
	Each unit has hit points (HP).<br>
	When hit points are reduced to 0, the unit is dead.<br>

	Each turn, a unit may attack another unit.<br>
	Damage done depends on attack skill, how fatigued a unit is and the target's damage resistance.<br>

	<h2>Attack Types</h2>
	There are several basic attacks you can do, each depends on how you start your attack.<br><br>
	<h3>Melee attack</h3>
	This is the default attack. To use it, you need to have a melee weapon in your left hand and choose the attack action.<br><br>
	<h3>Non-lethal melee attack</h3>
	This attack is the same as a normal melee attack, except that the target cannot be killed.<br>
	If the target's hit points would be reduced to 0, they're reduced to 1 instead and the target becomes unconscious.<br><br>
	<h3>Ranged attack</h3>
	To perform a ranged attack, you need a ranged weapon like a bow in your left hand.<br><br>
