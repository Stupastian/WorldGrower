  <h2>WorldGrower:Ghoul Transformation</h2>

	Ghouls are people that need human meat to survive.<br>
	You can become a ghoul by eating human meat.<br>
	<br>
	When you become a ghoul, you require human meat to continue functioning.<br>
	It's possible to restore your human meat level by eating human meat.<br>
	Once the human meat level gets low, the ghoul's energy gets drained.<br>
	<br>
	As a ghoul, you count as undead for all spell and item effects.<br>
	As an undead, you don't need to eat or drink, except for human meat.<br>
