  <h2>WorldGrower:Factions</h2>

	All villagers start out by belonging to the villagers faction.<br>
	Characters that violate the law and are discovered, are thrown out of the villagers faction.<br>
	Only by paying a bounty or serving time in jail can a character rejoin the villagers faction.<br>
	See <a href="Crime.htm">crime</a> for more information.<br>
	<br>
	It's possible to create profession or religion organizations.<br>
	These organizations have a custom name and custom goal.<br>
	<br>
	For example, it's possible to create a religious organization dedicated to converting others to a deity.<br>
	Or create a guild for a profession that sets the price of goods at a high level.<br>
