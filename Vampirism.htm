  <h2>WorldGrower:Vampirism</h2>

	Vampires are people infected with the disease Porphyric Hemophilia.<br>
	You can become a vampire by being bitten by one and contracting Porphyric Hemophilia.<br>
	When you have this disease for a long time, you will turn into a vampire.<br>
	Another way to become a vampire is to worship Dionysus.<br>
	If there are no other vampires in the world, Dionysus may bless the worshipper with vampirism.<br>
	<br>
	When you become a vampire, you require blood to continue functioning.<br>
	It's possible to restore your blood level by biting people or drinking blood.<br>
	Once the blood level gets low, the vampire's energy gets drained.<br>
	<br>
	As a vampire, you count as undead for all spell and item effects.<br>
	As an undead, you don't need to eat or drink, except for blood.<br>
