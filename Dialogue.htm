  <h2>WorldGrower:Dialogue</h2>

  Talking to another character is possible by moving next to it and choosing the talk action.<br><br>
  <img src="talkdialog.png" alt="talk dialog"><br><br>
	A question or remark is made by the player character and the other character responds.<br>
	The relationship with the other character is displayed which indicates how much the other character likes you.<br>
	Not all questions will be available all the time.<br>
	For example: asking to break up with someone is only possible if you're mates.<br>
	             Or asking to get cured of poison is only possible if you're poisoned.<br>
	<br>
	A similar dialog is used when another character talks to you:<br><br>
	<img src="response.png" alt="response dialog"><br><br>
	You have a list of possible responses, just like they do when you talk to them.<br>
	<br>
	For a list of dialogue options, see <a href="generated/gen_conversations.html">Dialogue Overview</a>.
