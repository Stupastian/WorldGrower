  <h2>WorldGrower:Lich Transformation</h2>

	Liches are undead spellcasters that have cast the lich transformation on themselves.<br>
	The lich transformation spell is a high-level necromancy spell.<br>
	The spell has steep requirements, namely several filled soul gems.<br>
	<br>
	When you become a lich, you gain a life steal ability.<br>
	This ability damages an opponent and heals you.<br>
	<br>
	As a lich, you count as undead for all spell and item effects.<br>
	As an undead, you don't need to eat or drink.<br>
